  section.p-1
    p I still remember the first time I solved a math problem without someone showing me how to do it first. I was five years old. My twin brother Jeff was undergoing treatment for leukemia, so we both had been pulled out of kindergarten (I had told my parents that I wanted to be with my brother instead of staying in school). As twins, we were, naturally, a bit competitive with each other. I was probably the more competitive one! We were playing a game where we each tried to stump each other with a hard question. I thought my question was pretty hard, because we had not yet learned how to multiply two digit numbers together. I’m not even sure if we knew our times tables yet. I asked, “What’s 50 times 50?” I succeeded in stumping my brother with this question. However, I had not anticipated that Jeff would ask me what the answer was. My competitiveness had lead me to ask a question that I had not yet answered myself. Suddenly, the answer came to me - fifty 50’s is half of one hundred 50’s. One hundred 50’s is fifty hundred, so half of that is twenty-five hundred. I was so excited that I shared my epiphany with everyone, from my parents to my brother’s nurses in the hospital.
    p My passion for math just grew after that. I went through my math textbooks and worksheets faster than my teachers could grade them. I picked up used math books from the thrift stores my mom and I frequented and taught myself as much as I could. My brother and I were homeschooled for almost every grade after my brother went into remission, so I was able to pursue my love of math more freely. I could go at my own pace and choose my textbooks.
    p Ever since I started being formally tested in math, I scored off the charts. I don’t say this to brag, I don’t think I’m a genius, but I do have some amount of natural aptitude. I can tell that I have an easier time “seeing the light” than many of my peers. I went to public school for second grade (and never again after that). One time, all three second grade classes were given the same math puzzle. I don’t quite remember the puzzle, but I do remember that after a moment of deep concentration, the answer came to me. I was excited and raised my hand and shared my answer. The teachers in the room did not tell me if I was correct or not. In fact, they seemed to think that no other student was prepared to answer this question, and they just gave up on teaching us. My parents were secretly told that I was the only person to answer this question correctly in the next parent meeting, but my teachers never told me.
    p Maybe my experiences in second grade were my first experiences of implicit sexism. I was never encouraged to do math by my teachers, in fact, I was sometimes discouraged because my teacher didn’t want to have to grade all of the extra math worksheets that I did. No one ever suggested (to me) that I was demonstrating an aptitude for math either. As someone who’s tutored several boys whose parents told me they were “math geniuses” and after talking to my male peers in grad school, it seems that boys are much more likely to be told they’re good at math, and often without even demonstrating the same level of skill that I had shown. I sometimes wonder how things would have turned out for me if someone guided my interest in math when I was a kid, instead of me studying mostly on my own until college (My mother put quite a bit of time into planning lessons for my brother and I when we were young, which I am very grateful for. After I advanced to a certain level, I studied more on my own.)
    p I was extremely excited to start taking math classes at college. I couldn’t take higher-level math classes such as calculus at my home-schooling program, so I had to wait to take these until I enrolled in my local community college. I was 17 when I took calculus. I loved it. It gave me tools to think about things and ask questions that were interesting to me. My college teachers quickly saw my interest in and aptitude for math, and they suggested that I major in math. It was not long after that that I switched majors to math and took every math class that I could. I participated in some math competitions and won some money and a couple of scholarships. My undergrad education culminated in a couple of paid research opportunities. I wrote my first paper in math research (“Torsion of Elliptic Curves Over Quadratic Fields”) during my senior year. I won second-place at a statewide research competition for this research.
    p It was during my undergrad years that I discovered pole dance. Pole was not my first athletic interest. I played basketball for years, and after that I roller skated. Roller skating was the first athletic discipline that inspired me creatively. I created my own tricks and was inspired by dance tricks and even gymnastics. I tried dancing for a few years too, but never quite felt like I fit in with my large shoulders (from lifting weights) and muscular thighs (from skating). I saw an ad for pole dancing lessons in the dance studio where I took belly dance classes. I had seen videos of pole dancing, and I thought it looked really fun. After my first class, I fell in love. My big muscles were no longer seen as an eyesore but rather necessary for pole. I excelled quickly because I had the upper body strength and had a pole at home to practice on. I won my first competition (at a strip club) within my first year of training. Big shoutout to my first pole instructor Christella, to whom I will be forever grateful for welcoming me into the world of pole dance!
  section.p-1
    p I moved away from my hometown Chico to Santa Cruz to begin my graduate studies at UCSC in pure math during the summer of 2013. I was very nervous. I had left all my friends, my twin and my parents, and my partner to pursue my dream of getting a PhD in math and continuing my research. I was all alone besides having brought my two cats, Klaus and Katja, with me.
    p While my undergrad studies had been an overall great experience filled with supportive instructors, my graduate experience was quite different. I’m not sure what changed, but from day one, I was hyper-aware of being one of the only non-males in my cohort and my classes. I have learned now that I was suffering from stereotype threat - the fear of confirming stereotypes such as the stereotype that females are not as good at math as males. Read more about how stereotype threat can impact students below. As a shy person, I had never liked going to the board in classes, but now in a room full of men, going to the board was even more stressful.
    p Despite all of my anxiety, I successfully completed my first year of grad school. I had made some friends in my program too, and I actually found that math people were quite a bit easier for me to talk to than other people. I also had found the local circus school, and had started teaching pole dance there. Finding somewhere to train was very helpful for mitigating the stress of grad school.
    p During my second year, things started to change. I was assaulted at a party. I’m not going into the details, but it took me a long time to process this. During the first quarter of my second year, something else traumatic happened that I will not be sharing either, but it’s something that haunts me everyday. I will refer to this simply as “The Nightmare,” as it still gives me nightmares. Needless to say, I was not really in a place to do math at that time. Math requires deep concentration, and when your thoughts are cluttered with other things it’s really not possible to do math. I also had an overwhelming feeling that my pursuit was selfish. I was away from my family and my brother who I believe needed me. The math that I was working on was so specialized that I couldn’t share it with anyone except other students in my program. I felt further isolated by doing math and I certainly didn’t feel like I was doing anything that was helping anyone else.

  section.p-1
    p  It was during this period that the time I spent at my circus school increased. I started teaching more classes and performing. Training was really the only way I could get some relief from the traumas I was dealing with and it was so rewarding to share my love of pole with my students. It’s amazing to see students progress and achieve things they never thought they could do. Pole students are often so grateful, and I really feel that teaching pole is a way that I can empower others. Choreographing for performances also gave me a way to tell a story or share a feeling through movement, which was (and is) therapeutic for me.
    p I was taking a math class that I was very interested in during the first quarter of my second year. It was taught by my assigned mentor and it was in a field that I thought I might want to pursue as a specialty. The only thing that made me nervous was that the grade for this class was entirely based on presenting a solution to a homework exercise. After the first week, I solved all of the exercises on the first problem set, but I got too nervous to present any of them. I went to my mentor’s office hours and attempted to show him my solutions and explain that I was nervous about presenting. He refused to look at my work and said there was no reason for me to be nervous, completely oblivious to the fact that as the only non-male in his class, there were additional challenges that I was facing that other students were not. He even said that he had expected that I would drop out! This professor never looked me in the eye during class, and he never acknowledged me when I ran into him outside of class (though he would acknowledge my male classmates who were with me). I began to feel unwelcome in his class. I continued doing the homeworks on my own (and not presenting any solutions) until The Nightmare happened. After that it was really hard to do math and I definitely struggled during the second half of that quarter. The second-to-last week of class, I planned to present a solution. I prepared and practiced with my friends, but when it came time to present, I was so nervous that I did not do my best. It didn’t help that the instructor sort of grilled me with follow up questions that I hadn’t prepared for (which he didn’t ask of other students).
    p The professor asked me to come into his office after this. I did, prepared to accept whatever he thought I deserved in terms of my grade and also to share a plan of how I could learn the material better. However, as I soon realized, he had called me into his office so he could berate me. He claimed that I was a “minimalist” and that I had only been allowed to get my previous math degree because American schools allow students to be lazy and get away with it. He told me that I had read in his syllabus that I only needed to present one solution to pass his class and that I had decided to do the minimum amount of work, somehow forgetting that I had been solving all of the homework exercises previously and had even come to his office to share my solutions. He said I wouldn’t be able to get a PhD. There was a lot more. It was pretty hard to endure. When I finally got a chance to speak, I said I had “a lot going on,” referring to The Nightmare. He quickly said “I don’t want to hear about that.” I wouldn’t be surprised if he assumed that I was referring to pole dancing, which I was pretty open about doing. Or maybe he just didn’t care and he didn’t think I fit the mold of someone who should be allowed to do math. I replied, “Then fail me.” He seemed very surprised that I said this and quickly responded that he “wouldn’t do that” to me. Somehow berating me was less bad than failing me? This instructor was also mentoring one of my male friends in this class. My friend missed almost every class and presented one solution on the very last day (there were a number of students who also didn’t present until the last day). He did not receive a passing grade (I did), and our mentor never called him into his office. He is still on track to receive his PhD.
    p The same professor also prevented me from attending an MSRI summer program. The program reserves one spot for non-males from every participating school, and I was the only non-male to apply, but my mentor would not support me. All the men who applied to this program got to go, including those who actually failed classes (I passed all of my classes).
    p Another female student in the pure math program shared with me that the same instructor had loudly proclaimed during the department tea time that in order for any female students to be let into the PhD program, he and the deciding faculty had to lower the bar for GRE scores. I compared my GRE score to a few other male students, and we all had essentially the same scores.
    p I went to Title IX to talk about what had happened to me. They acknowledged that my story indicated that this instructor should be investigated for sexual discrimination. However, they suggested that I drop out of the program! They said that during the investigation, the instructor would know that I had filed a report against him, which would make things difficult for me since he would be grading my exams. I did not move forward with the report.
    p After that, I wanted to just drop out. I couldn’t manage everything going on with me personally, and I no longer felt welcome in the program. These experiences killed my love of math, at least for a few years. One of my peers talked me into staying for a bit longer, but it was rough. I also was approached by another one of my instructors who wanted to do research with me, which was encouraging. (Students often have to ask instructors to work with them, not the other way around.) This instructor told me that I was the only student who would redo homework assignments after reading her feedback, and I guess she could see my drive. Clearly I was not a lazy student.
    p I really tried to get back into math, but I just couldn’t at that time. I couldn’t study on campus anymore because I’d always run into my previous mentor. One time I walked into the shared grad student offices to be greeted by a sign saying “No girls allowed.” I appreciated the support of my advisor, but her research was not in the field that I was interested in either. I stuck it out for as long as I could (three years) but I just couldn’t continue after that. I also hated the idea of not performing to the best of my abilities, and I knew I could not do that at UCSC.

    p While I was feeling less and less welcome in math spaces, the opposite was happening in pole spaces. My abilities were improving, I was getting more teaching opportunities (including starting a pole and aerial hoop series through UCSC’s recreation department), and I was getting paid work as a performer. While math people were pushing me out, pole dancers were welcoming me. At this point, there really was no other choice I could have made. I was allowed to train and excel at pole and my students were a joy to teach, which was completely opposite of my experience of doing math in grad school.
    p Unfortunately, working professionally in circus arts often involves a lot of contract work, and income can be very unpredictable. I put in many unpaid hours to prepare and choreograph acts for gigs. I was (and still am) living in Santa Cruz, and I did not feel financially secure living on this income, though I have at times supported myself just on my circus arts work.
    p I started teaching math at several community colleges to supplement my income. I have found that teaching math is also rewarding. I like helping students realize that they can do math despite what their preconceived notions are about who can do math. I also have found that writing challenging problems for my higher-level classes is a way that I can still enjoy doing math.
    p While community colleges have been more welcoming than my grad program, I’m still never allowed to forget that I do not fit the mold of someone who can do math. On my first day teaching at one college, I was helping students figure out what class to take while working at a booth near the math department. The dean was there with me, and I had even shared a bit of my experience at grad school with him. An older instructor walked over, and the dean introduced me. I was teaching statistics that semester. The instructor asked me, “What’s the probability that you’d kiss me on a first date?” I was stunned and ashamed. I couldn’t speak. I felt worthless, reduced to just a body. The dean was surprised too and did not respond. After the instructor walked away, the dean excused this act of sexual harassment by stating, “I guess he’s of a different generation.” I did not continue teaching there for long. I’ve also had students exclaim that I “don’t look like a math teacher” a number of times. I know these students don’t mean anything by it, but it really doesn’t feel good to be othered. As someone who is not a natural public speaker, hearing this on the first day of class makes me more nervous. I’ve experienced some backlash from male students as well. Some men have a really hard time with a female-presenting and relatively young-looking instructor knowing more math than them. In general, students rate male instructors higher. Check out the resources below if you want to read about this.
    p It may not help that I do not teach math in a traditional way. I think quite a few math instructors at community colleges may not have studied pure math, but rather something more applied. Many have not done research in pure math. I like to share what I know and what excites me about math, so I focus more on mathematical proofs and theorems. I also enjoy writing my own problem sets instead of using traditional textbook exercises. I try to write exercises that are explorative and may lead to a surprising or insightful result, or possibly show a connection to another seemingly-unrelated topic. In learning, there is always struggle. If there is no struggle, learning is not happening. I think one big difference between teaching movement and teaching math is that students often come to class with a different attitude. If students are expecting to work out, naturally they expect to struggle a bit. When students attend a math lecture, they often expect an instructor to show them math, but they may not actually expect to do math in class, especially if they’re asked to do problems that aren’t nearly the same as the ones the instructor showed them how to do. I often ask my students to do these struggle-inducing types of exercises.
    p I am at a point now where I’m not sure what my place in mathematics is. I know that I will always do math. I can’t imagine ever not asking math questions and then trying to find the solution. However, I’m not really sure what math spaces will welcome me and where my strengths would be most useful. On the other hand, the pole community has been overall welcoming and allowed me to grow as a pole athlete. I know that my (now 11 years!) experience is respected. I have built up my connections and have been fortunate to have been given many opportunities. The pandemic, of course, has put some of this on hold, however, it has given me time to reflect. Maybe it’s time for me to spend my time and energy in a space that respects me and appreciates what I have to offer. What do you think?

  section.p-1(aria-label='introduction')
    p When I moved to Santa Cruz in 2013, I started dropping into pole classes at the local circus school, Aerial Arts Santa Cruz. Shortly after, the studio owner, Jeanette, offered me my first teaching job. It is fairly common in this industry for advanced students to be asked to start teaching at some point. I was extremely excited to have the opportunity to share my passion and to spend more time in the studio. However, aside from giving a teaching demo at this studio, I had never taught pole dance or any other movement discipline professionally before. Something that might be surprising is that my math teaching job began in a very similar way. I studied math for a long time, applied for a job at a school and gave a teaching demo, and then I was offered a teaching position despite never having learned how to teach. During the beginning of my career as an instructor, I tried to emulate what my own teachers had done. Since then, I’ve developed my own teaching style, gone to teaching conferences (for academics, but I’ve found some of the information to be relevant to teaching circus arts as well), read about pedagogy, and spent many hours learning about anatomy and physiology for circus arts. I’ve taught in a variety of different venues, including five different studios, UC Santa Cruz’s recreation department, and a number of workshops at studios I've visited and special events. I’m going to share some of the things I learned and what I now think about when I plan a pole dance or aerial class.
  section.p-1
    h2 Before Making a Plan
    p Before I start planning a class, it’s important for me to be familiar with the space I’ll be teaching in. How many students per pole will there be? Are there crash mats? What’s the spacing between poles like? What kinds of poles are there (size, metal, what’s the base like and could it impede any floor tricks, can the poles go on spin and static). Thinking about these things helps me determine how much time is needed for each part of class and how I’ll keep students safe.
    p I also like to think about what my goals, or my students’ goals, for class are. I do this with my own training sessions as well. For example, do my students need to work on their straddle inverts to become comfortable in inverted combos? Do my students need to work on active flexibility? Having a goal in mind makes my class more focused and can help students progress more quickly.
    p Most instructors play music during their classes. This is especially helpful for warm-ups and free dances. Music can set the mood of the class and can set the warm-up pace. Creating a playlist ahead of time is ideal. I want to make sure that I’ve included songs that aren’t offensive to anyone in my class and that the tempo is right for the movements I’m teaching. I sometimes like to ask students for music suggestions as well to accommodate their preferences. If I’m not able to do this, I try to include songs in a variety of genres.

  section.p-1
    h2 Writing a Class Plan
    p If you’re new to teaching, I highly recommend writing down a class plan or outline. I always did this when I first started teaching, and I still do this when I’m teaching a workshop/special event type class, or if I’m teaching a new class (for example, when I started teaching virtually during the pandemic, I made class plans until I became comfortable with the new format). I don’t generally need to look at my class plan when I’m actually teaching, but writing everything down ahead of time ensures that I’ve thought about things like timing and remedial/advanced variations of tricks. I find that I’m more confident (which likely makes my students feel more confident in me) when I know that I’ve thoroughly prepared. I like to include the following elements in each class:
    ul
      li introductions & announcements
      li warm-up
      li conditioning (on pole)
      li tricks/combos
      li free practice/free dance
    p As I write my plan, I'm constantly thinking about student safety. I think about how I’ll spot tricks, if I’m spotting. If I’m not spotting students, I think about what extra instructions and tools I’ll give them so they can keep themselves safe. Teaching a “bail-out” of a trick (i.e. how to safely exit a trick if something goes wrong) is a great option for students who aren’t being spotted. I also think about the points of contact of each trick in my combo so I know what to look out for when I watch students and so students are informed of what the trick should feel like when it’s done properly. Finally, I like to think about common mistakes for each movement and keep an eye out for these as students try out each trick. Many students get injuries because they proceed with a trick but their muscles aren’t properly engaged or their joints are not in safe positions. For example, should shoulders be in external or internal rotation? When I first began teaching, I also studied photos of different joint positions and what it looks like to have certain muscles engaged, and now I can easily identify these things on students. Thinking about these things ahead of time helps me prevent student injuries.
    p Something that I’ve consistently heard at math conferences is that community is essential for learning. Students need to feel that they are a part of the class/studio community in order to feel comfortable going through the learning process. Learning requires some amount of struggle, and at times this can be frustrating or uncomfortable. Most students in pole dance classes are asked to wear something not much bigger than a bathing suit, and students need to feel safe enough to do this. If students feel that they are part of a community of people who are all struggling and learning together, then students will generally perform better. One way to facilitate community building is to begin class with introductions. I think this is especially essential for beginner classes. The prompts I use for these introductions generally follow this format:
    ol
      li Name and preferred pronouns
      li A pole related question such as number of classes/number of years of pole experience
      li A “small talk” question such as “What’s something you’re looking forward to this weekend?”
    p I sometimes also ask if anyone has any injuries, however, if possible, I prefer to ask students privately about this. For my smaller classes, I usually try to check in with each student about how they’re feeling before class begins. Finally, I share any announcements that I may have, such as a new class or upcoming performance. In a beginner class, I always make sure to introduce students to the studio and venue as well - where the restrooms are, what types of poles they’ll be using, and anything else they might need to know.
    p Next, every class must include a warm-up. It is essential to warm-up the body before any training session. Skipping the warm-up increases the chance of injury. I generally use 10-30 minutes of class time for the warm-up, depending on how long the class is and what I’m teaching (if extreme flexibility is required, then more time must be spent warming up things like splits or backbends). When designing a warm-up, I think about what tricks I’ll be asking students to do and what muscles and joints are involved in these movements. It’s always necessary to warm-up shoulders and hips for pole dance. I also like to focus on active flexibility exercises and minimize passive stretching. When I put together my first warm-up, I borrowed exercises that I liked from classes I’d taken, and I also looked up YouTube warm-up videos for dance and aerial classes. Since I don’t have any formal training in exercise science, I have spent many hours learning from professionals in this. I recommend the following Instagram accounts for information on warm-up exercises, mobility drills, anatomy and more: cirque_physio (Dr. Jen Crane), technique_artist, the_artist_athlete (Shannon McKenna), thecircusdoc (Dr. Emily Scherb) and ptthepole. I also recommend the following books: Applied Anatomy of Aerial Arts: An Illustrated Guide to Strength, Flexibility Training, and Injury Prevention by Dr. Emily Scherb; Aerial Inversions for All! and One Arm Positions for Aerialists by Shannon McKenna; Strength and Conditioning for Pole by Neola Wilby (ptthepole).

  .p-1
    p After warming-up on the ground, I always use a portion of class time for on-apparatus conditioning. Increasing strength is essential for making progress. For beginners, conditioning usually includes scapular pull-ups (also known as “shrugs”), a core exercise, and climbing practice. I spend more class time conditioning for more advanced classes. My most advanced class does straddle invert drills, shoulder mount drills, and conditioning for deadlifts. I like to use the low floor-high ceiling principle: the entry level exercise is accessible for everyone in class, but the most advanced student is also challenged. In general, strength exercises can be made easier if the pole or floor supports some body weight. Exercises can be made harder by removing points of contact with the pole or moving the hips farther from the pole (this is why straddle inverts are easier than shoulder mounts - that’s why the latter requires more strength). For my own training, if I spend most of my time conditioning, then tricks easily follow. When I was trick-focused in the past, I often hit plateaus in my development. I’ve also seen other dancers constantly get injured if they didn’t condition enough.
    p I present the main content for class after conditioning. This often looks like a combo. I usually include this as a video in my class plan and then list out the main tricks. In my beginner classes, there are core movements that I regularly include to prepare students for the intermediate level (sit, fan kick, chair spin). I try to include at least one of these in each combo. For my more advanced classes, I usually present some of the tricks that I’m currently exploring or a piece of choreography I’ve recently put together. It’s really helpful if I know who will be attending class ahead of time so that I can accommodate my students’ levels and skills (for example, if I have a student who loves backbending, I make sure to include a backbendy option). I love including student requests as well (this is another question I sometimes ask in the beginning of class), but I always make sure to have something planned if students don’t have requests (often students don’t). I also make sure to include variations of each new trick I’m teaching following the low floor-high-ceiling principle. Tricks can be made easier by adding points of contact and made harder by taking them away. Most tricks also have extreme flexibility variations, and even if I can’t demo these, I explain them to flexible students. It’s essential that every student is able to achieve at least one trick or piece of the combo so that they feel accomplished. It’s also important that every student leaves class with something to work on.
    p  Unless I teach a longer combo, I leave some class time for students to do their own exploration. This may look like improvised dancing to a particular song, or their own practice time. Sometimes I may give students a prompt to guide their exploration, such as putting a couple tricks in a sequence or creating their own variation of a trick. Especially if students don’t have a pole to practice on at home, they need to be able to run through their pole vocabulary regularly. If students aren’t allowed to film during class, this can be a time for students to film themselves as well.
    p Finally, I wrap up class with a quick cool-down. Lats (back muscles), deltoids (shoulder muscles), traps (muscles in the upper back and near the neck), and forearm muscles will likely be sore after class, so I try to include some gentle stretches for this. Many pole dancers have over-developed traps (myself included) and these can pull on the neck muscles, so I like to include some controlled, slow neck circles. If students were asked to do any extreme flexibility tricks, I make sure to include exercises to “put them back together.” For example, after backbending, I make sure to do some core exercises like dead bugs.

  section.p-1(aria-label='introduction')
    p “Aren’t you happy?! Why aren’t you excited?!” my coworker at my local circus school exclaimed to me after we had just received some good news. I don’t quite remember what we had just heard, maybe it had to do with a performance or competition opportunity, but I do remember this conversation. I was excited! But then I felt frustrated. Everyone else in the room was jumping up and down, laughing, shouting, smiling. I was standing off to the side, an other, silent, and still. What’s wrong with me? Why can’t I interact and express myself like everyone else? I’ll never fit in. They must think I’m such a weirdo. I was bombarded with thoughts like these and felt an inexpressible loneliness. This memory is just one of countless interactions like this throughout my entire life. I didn’t know it at the time, but my inability to express myself nonverbally was due to my autism.
    p Social issues are  one of the defining features of autism, and the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) lists “Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts” as part of the diagnostic criteria. I have struggled to socialize and connect with others for as long as I can remember. I am a twin, and my twin was my only friend for a good portion of my life. I desperately wanted to have other friends when I was young, but I stressed so much about behaving “appropriately” and knowing what to say that I would usually talk myself out of initiating anything. I also recall having conflicting feelings when others would begin a conversation with me - I was happy that someone was talking to me, but I was so anxious that it was painful for me, and I’d end the conversation as quickly as possible. I was diagnosed with anxiety as a young adult, but it took many more years for my autism diagnosis, even though my social anxiety stems from my autism.
    p When I was a child, and even as a young adult, I really had no idea what autism was. I had seen images of young kids throwing tantrums and heard stories of non-speaking children who would rock back and forth and mimic noises. I get the feeling that nobody else in my childhood knew about autism either, otherwise I like to believe they would have tried to get me help sooner. During the pandemic, I lost almost all my performance and circus teaching jobs, but the upside was that I actually had time to research autism. I was surprised to learn that autism would explain so much about me and my struggles.
  section.p-1
    h2 What is Autism?
    p Autism, also referred to as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a neurodevelopmental disorder. It appears early in childhood and there is no cure. If someone has autism, their brain develops in a different way than someone who does not have autism. If you do not have autism, your brain does not work the same as mine, and our experiences of the world may be very different due to this.
    p The best definition of autism that I have heard is that it is a collection of disorders. I don’t really like to use the term “disorder,” as there are parts of my autism that I cherish, but there certainly are aspects of my autism that cause difficulties for me socially and in my jobs. There’s a common phrase that is used in many autistic educational spaces: “If you've met one person with autism, you' ve met one person with autism” by Dr. Stephen Shore. This statement is a bit silly since it is a tautology, but I like that it emphasizes the importance of learning about many autistic people if you really want to understand autism. Because autism is a collection of disorders, not every autistic person has every one of these disorders, and each disorder may manifest in a distinct way and at a different intensity. I think this graphic really sums this up well.

    p To be diagnosed with autism, a person must exhibit social and repetitive behaviors to an extent that it limits their ability to function in society. Repetitive behaviors can be obsessions, rituals, or fidgets, for example. The DSM includes “Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities” as part of the diagnostic criteria for autism.
    p Many autistic people also have sensory processing disorder (SPD). This means that many autistic people are either hypersensitive or hyposensitive in regards to sensory data. For example, some autistic people are hypersensitive to sounds, and background noise can be painful and overstimulating. These sensory issues can have a huge impact on how comfortable or functional an autistic person can be in certain spaces. I’ll get into my sensory issues in the next section.
    p Stimming is a common behavior among autistic people, likely due to sensory issues, however, non-autistic people stim too. Stimming refers to “self-stimulation.” It feels good to stim and it helps autistic people regulate themselves. Stims can look like rocking back and forth, humming to oneself, flapping hands, for example. Stims often depend on a person’s sensory sensitivities. Unfortunately, stimming in public is often looked down on even though it is necessary for autistic people to do this.
    p If you really want to know what autism is, I highly suggest learning from autistic people who choose to share about their experiences. Listening to one autistic person is not enough because the autistic experience can be so different. I began learning about autism by listening to Paige Layle, the podcast The Audacious Autistics, and following Instagram accounts by autistic people such as @neurodifferent.
  section.p-1
    h2 My Autism
    p I’ve already shared a bit of my experience with social anxiety. Many autistic people get anxious in social situations because they’ve had so many negative social experiences. In fact, there is some evidence to suggest that these repeated, negative social interactions (including bullying and harassment - autistic people are more vulnerable to these things) may lead to PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) or CPTSD (complex post traumatic stress disorder). I am at the beginning stage of fully understanding my diagnosis, but the person who diagnosed me as autistic stated that I exhibit symptoms of trauma.
    p I have many social deficits. One that may be more observable is my lack of facial expressions. For people who know me, this might be hard to believe, but I actually have improved in this matter quite a bit. Early on, I realized that I was not displaying my emotions on my face, and I studied people (like my mom, who I identified as exemplary in social situations) to learn how to smile and make other expressions. On a related note, I also struggle to read other people’s facial expressions. For these reasons, I highly prefer literal communication. I prefer it when people ask me how I’m feeling and I’ll also ask them how they’re feeling. I make a habit of generally telling people if I’m not happy about something. If I don’t say anything, I’m probably happy with how things are going. I have often wished that other people would make this a habit as well, as I’ve frequently felt like I was missing some key information in conversations, and even if I tried to ask questions, apparently I didn’t ask the right questions, and I still had no idea why the interaction didn’t go well.
    p Similar to my inability to express emotions through facial expressions, I also do not use my tone to convey emotion. I have been described as a “robot.” I have tried to work on this, but I still find that my voice is more monotone. When my math students have provided me feedback through student reviews, the most consistent criticism that I’ve received is that I appear to lack enthusiasm, despite the fact that I am very enthusiastic about math. I often read and do math in my free time.
    p I sometimes struggle to recognize faces. When I was used to tutor math as an undergrad, I always made sure to arrive at our meeting location first so my students would have to find me versus me having to recognize them. I have some ability in this matter, but I especially have trouble when I see people out of context or if someone is just an acquaintance. I have often walked by people who know me without acknowledging them. Sometimes these people have told me I was rude. Other times people have shared with me that they just thought I didn’t like them. This makes me sad because when this has happened, I almost always liked the person and wanted to interact.
    p My eye contact during conversations is different than most people’s. I was made aware of this after a number of people told me they thought I was rolling my eyes at them. I realized that I was not able to look people in the eyes when I was thinking. I practiced my eye contact quite a bit as a teenager, because I thought I wasn’t making eye contact appropriately. Now I am able to maintain eye contact while someone is talking to me, but I still can’t look someone in the eye when I’m talking. It’s overstimulating and distracting to me, likely due to my sensory issues.
    p I often don’t understand social rules. For example, “small talk” makes no sense to me and I’d rather not participate in it. I used to say that I hated it when the clerk checking me out at a grocery store asked me how I was doing because I had to choose between lying by saying “I’m fine” or telling the truth (saying something like “I’m stressed out” or “I’m depressed”) and being socially inappropriate. I don’t understand social constructs like gender. I really struggle to comprehend any reason why I need to identify someone by their genitals in almost any context. Dress codes seem arbitrary and unnecessary. These are just some examples of social rules that I have trouble following.
    p I have been described as obsessive. If I like something, I really like it. I have to know everything about it. When I was a child, I went from obsession to obsession, from basketball, to the band the Scorpions (I wrote a book about the Scorpions when I was 12), to roller skating, and eventually to pole dance. While I’ve also been diagnosed with OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder, which is commonly diagnosed with autism), my OCD is tied to my autism. Most of my obsessions are things that help me regulate myself when I’m overwhelmed. It is better for me if others do not try to stop me from doing my obsessions. For example, the only thing that gives me relief when I’m really overwhelmed is working out (usually on pole). Even though it may seem like I work out too much sometimes, and it does get in the way of work and relationships at times, it is necessary for me to be functional. When I am focused on my training, it may seem like I ignore everyone else. This is not really something I can control. It’s not intentional and it has no reflection on my feelings for those people. If I am interrupted, I may get upset (I’m sorry!).
    p Related to fixations is having routines. I have learned to adapt my rituals to an extent to accommodate living with others and traveling. However, if I’m not allowed to go through my routine, I feel extreme stress. I have forced myself to do this at times because I thought that I was being unreasonable, but now that I know I have autism, I know that my need for these routines is necessary for me to be comfortable considering that my brain works differently than most people around me. For example, I get really stressed out if I can’t take a shower at certain times during the day. Sometimes this can seem disruptive to others if I’m in a group of people. In general, I usually plan to take care of my own needs on my own schedule and I will join others wherever they are when I’m done with my routine. It is helpful for me if people don’t make a big deal about this and let me take care of my own needs.
    p I have two more pronounced sensory issues. I am hypersensitive to light. I need sunglasses when I’m outside or around bright lights. If I don’t have sunglasses, it’s painful. My eyes have even swollen shut just from the sunlight before. Before my autism diagnosis, I had no idea what was going on. I thought that it was possibly due to my poor eyesight or a genetic condition. Now it is clear to me that it is from my autism. While this sensory issue causes me discomfort at times, it can also be beautiful. I stim sometimes by staring at things that I find “visually stimulating.” I actually started using this term years before I knew I was autistic, but I knew that I enjoyed looking at colorful things (and wearing colorful clothing) or detailed things. I have many memories of going into my parents’ backyard as a child and staring at the plants or moss. I loved it, it was so pleasing to me. I also would create detailed works of art in my head. To my frustration, I was never able to physically produce these works of art. Many autistic people can create things completely in their heads. Another example of this is that I can create pole, aerial, and acrobatic combos without actually doing them physically. I can run through these combos in my head to determine if they will work or not. Temple Grandin is a very well-known autistic person who created machinery in her head and could also test whether it would work by just testing it in her mind.

    p My other sensory issue is not a good one. It might sound beneficial at times, but it’s damaging to me. I do not process pain the way other people do. I am likely tactile hyposensitive. I have been hurt many times by other people and even by myself because I didn’t feel enough to know that I was being hurt. For example, I can train for hours and then suddenly I’ll see that there’s a patch of skin completely missing from a body part (yes, I’ve really trained through this and only became aware after seeing it). I was burned at my physical therapist’s office because I didn’t feel that the heat pad was too hot. I recently have been going to a physical therapist for a chronic wrist injury, and I found myself unable to tell my therapist when something hurt because everything he did just felt the same to me, much to his frustration. These are just a couple examples of how this affects me. I also have a stim related to tactile stimulation - I really like to touch soft or fuzzy things like pillows, or even repetitively pet my cat.
    p Dyspraxia is a common disorder among autistic people and it is related to sensory processing disorder. Someone with dyspraxia may look uncoordinated. This may sound surprising, but I have dyspraxia. While I have trained extensively in movement, I still find that I’ll trip over my feet, I bump my hip bones into corners all the time, and I have poor hand-eye coordination. It’s frustrating and embarrassing. I often feel like a dork when I trip and people make fun of me. I can’t count how many times I’ve tripped or bumped into something while I was teaching a math class. In pole competitions, I’ve almost always tripped while just stepping on the ground after completing some impressive pole pass. It’s definitely worse when I’m nervous, but I find myself walking into things even when no one else is around.
    p I can be forgetful and spacey. I’ll forget to eat and drink water often. This is possibly due to a sensory issue as well as some short-term memory issues. I find it helpful when people remind me about things I have to do. I think the only things that I really remember consistently have to do with the things that I’m passionate about.
    p There are some common patterns related to IQ and autism. One of mine is called hyperlexia. I was reading books for adults when I was ten. I also was fascinated by words and numbers, and I memorized entire discographies, license plates, scientific names of snakes, and more. I have a photographic memory, and when I was a child, I spent quite a bit of time practicing this skill. One time my dad flipped through a book, read something on a page, and then he turned to another page in a completely different section of the book only to realize he wanted to reread the first page he had seen. The page number just popped out of my mouth. I didn’t really even realize I’d seen it, and we were both surprised. My parents also recently told me that they always knew they could rely on me to recall things like parking space numbers.
    p I am gifted in mathematics. I don’t mean to brag about this, I’m only proud of my abilities that are due to hard work. I had to take an IQ test as a part of my autism diagnosis, and I was not surprised to learn this. I tend to be quite logical, and I have an easy time following instructions precisely. I have observed that many people around me are not as logical. Sometimes this can be very confusing and frustrating for me. When I went to grad school to study pure mathematics, I noticed that I had a much easier time to communicating with my peers, and I think that this is in part due to math students being trained in logical thinking.

    h2 My Experience as an Autistic Movement Artist
    .p-1.text-center
      iframe(src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/-drc3yoVdc4', title='YouTube video player', allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture', allowfullscreen='', width='740', height='416', frameborder='0')
    p I always loved movement arts. I was especially fascinated by dance. I tried out many forms of dance as a young adult. However, I rarely felt like I fit in, and now I know that is because my brain works differently than most of the people in these spaces.
    p When I was starting out, some people felt the need to point out that I was klutzy, uncoordinated, or didn’t look like a dancer. I heard statements like these from coaches, fellow students, and even someone I dated. It was hurtful and unnecessary. I was never the kind of student who improved after receiving “tough love” treatment, rather I’d improve given clear, constructive criticism. When people said mean things to me, it made it almost impossible for me to participate. If I get really stressed out, I shut down. It feels like I’m moving through water, my brain is melting, and sometimes I can’t even speak because my throat gets so tight. It would have been helpful for me if people didn’t point out something that I already knew I struggled with, especially as I was just beginning to learn a certain movement. Now, I do not really get comments like this much, at least when I pole dance (I like to think that I’ve become a graceful dancer), but people still raise an eyebrow when I trip while walking.
    p The hardest part for me in pole and circus arts is socializing. I am often othered and do not feel like I’m a member of the group. Artists are often charismatic, loud, and very outgoing. I can easily get overwhelmed in these spaces and find it difficult to participate. People have assumed that I do not care to interact, or that I’m not trying hard enough, or they may make some other negative assumption about me. I have been most successful in spaces where I’m given a chance to speak up and on my own terms.

    p To some extent, I think that having charisma is considered a necessary part of being a successful circus artist. I am sure that I have sometimes not been offered gigs due to my lack of facial expressions. I certainly agree that having a “big character” can make an act more engaging, but I also find that there are other characteristics that I enjoy more when I watch other circus artists and when I take other people’s classes. There is not one way to dance, and everyone will have different preferences on what they like about dance, and I think it’s important to see diversity in instructors and performers. Personally, I find it overwhelming when an instructor is overly enthusiastic, and sometimes it comes off as superficial. I know that this type of persona is useful for many students of movement, but I always hope that studios I visit have an instructor who is a bit quieter (and not overstimulating) and provides clear and literal directions.
    p If pole dance had not been one of my fixations, I do not think I could have continued for long. I really only was able to survive all of the social miscommunications, frustrations, and criticisms because I love pole dance and it’s what I think about and do during almost all of my free-time. It also helped that I was able to set up my own equipment and practice on my own. I know that many people prefer to train with others, but I really enjoy training on my own so I can focus on my goals and development.
    p Because pole dance is one of my obsessions, I have made it a priority to learn as much about it as I possibly can. I also really enjoy talking about everything I know about pole, and I think this is something that has made me a successful instructor.
    p I believe that I have been able to work and participate in society for so long without knowing about my autism largely due to my ability to mask. Masking, in terms of autism, is essentially hiding one’s autistic traits and pretending to be neurotypical. Autistic non-males are generally better at masking than autistic males, and this is partly why autistic non-males are often diagnosed much later or never. Masking, while it might seem like a good thing, is detrimental to autistic people. It is exhausting and can lead to burnout. I often mask while I teach pole because I do not know if it will be a safe space for me to show my autism. Now that I know about how harmful masking is, I’m trying to do it as little as possible. I prefer to teach more advanced classes where I am familiar with most of the students versus teaching a class full of brand new beginners that I’ve never met before. In the latter case, I know that I’ll have to motivate and excite these new students, and I’m always very worried about making a good impression. This results in me masking the whole time and feeling completely drained after a sixty-minute class.
  section.p-1
    h2 Diagnosis
    p I have known that there is something going on with me for quite a while. I tried to share some of my difficulties with partners, friends, family, teachers, doctors, and therapists, but due to the lack of awareness of autism (and likely due to the fact that autism is under-diagnosed in non-males), none of these people ever suggested that I might be autistic. A handful of other people (not anyone close to me) mentioned to me that I might be autistic. I never really took these people seriously because of my own lack of awareness. I’ve also noticed that many people tend to treat those who excel at math as highly unusual, and I wondered if they were just saying this because my abilities in math made me seem alien to them.
    p During the pandemic, I finally found myself at a point in my life where I had free time, a supportive partner, health insurance, and I knew I was about to have a breakdown if I didn’t get help. Now I know that I was experiencing “autistic burnout.” So I sought out the services of a psychiatrist.
    p Sadly, it still took nine months to get diagnosed. I talked to my psychiatrist about what I was experiencing, and she quickly diagnosed me with depression, anxiety, and OCD. At this point, autism was finally on my mind. I researched autism extensively, and after several sessions with my psychiatrist, I brought up that I might be autistic. I don’t think she knew much about it, but she seemed to think it could describe me, and she initiated the process of finding a neuropsychologist to diagnose me.
    p It took almost six months to find a neuropsychologist relatively close to where I live (still about an hour’s drive away), who also took my insurance, and who was accepting new clients. The process of calling many different people to try to get an appointment was exhausting and disheartening. I almost gave up. The assessment itself is quite expensive, upwards of one thousand dollars. I was so desperate for help, however, that I just knew I needed to do it to survive. It makes me sad that many autistic people will not be in a place to get the help that they need because this process is so expensive and difficult.
    p I connected with the neuropsychologist that I went to right away. If I had not felt somewhat comfortable with this psychologist, the process would have been much harder to complete. I’m very grateful that she made my experience as easy as possible. With that being said, I had to fill out countless forms and questionnaires (some with upwards of three hundred questions), go through a zoom intake interview, attend a 5 hour in person assessment including an IQ exam, provide personal references who were then interviewed (my partner, my mother, my psychiatrist, and my therapist), and finish up with a feedback session. It was completely overwhelming. I could not have finished it without the support of my partner.

    p I felt a wave of relief when my neuropsychologist told me that I am autistic. It was validating. It explains many of my difficulties. She offered me support in getting work accommodations and suggestions for my sensory difficulties. While the process was overwhelming, I am so grateful that I was able to go through it, and now I can get the help that I need.
    p I am also excited to meet more people like me. I have had so many issues communicating with neurotypical people (people without developmental issues) and feeling excluded from many spaces (because most spaces are made for neurotypical people). Now I feel like there is a huge community of autistic people who are more likely to be understanding of my difficulties and will probably be easier for me to communicate with.
    p As an autistic performer and circus artist, I want to create a space for other autistic people to feel safe participating in circus arts. Pole dance has been so helpful for me personally, and I want to share it with other people with similar difficulties. I look forward to being an activist for autistic people in the circus arts world and spreading awareness. If you are autistic and interested in circus arts, I would love to connect with you!

  section.p-1(aria-label='introduction')
    p Do you struggle with any type of inversion, on the ground or in the air? Do your backbends feel unstable or alway end up too much in your low back? Does your belly “pooch” whenever you sit up? Do you suffer from low back pain? When one of my students complains of any of these issues, the first thing I check is generally their core engagement, and more specifically, their deep core activation.
    p Before getting into any details, I want to mention that I am only a fitness coach and an athlete. I am not a doctor or physio. While I did not study kinesiology or any related field in college, I do have years of experience coaching students, identifying movement problems, and creating exercises to address these issues. In the following sections, I will be referencing experts and will include some useful readings by these specialists if you’d like to learn more.
    p One more thing. People often confuse core strength with six-pack abs. This blog is not about how to get six-pack abs. While deep core strengthening can have a flattening effect on the belly, that is not the main intention of the exercises that will be shared here. Also, all bodies are different, and while everyone can strengthen their core, not everyone can safely get six-pack abs. Getting “ripped” is often more about diet and cardio exercise than strength training, and that’s all I’m going to say about that.

      figcaption
        | C-curve in lateral flexion (top left), spinal flexion (bottom right), spinal extension
    p Strengthening the core muscles has two main purposes: (1) increasing torso curling ability in the front, side, and back directions and (2) improving stability. In terms of torso curling, we can shorten the distance from our hips to our shoulders by using our front core (like the position of the body while performing a crunch, referred to as spinal flexion), side core (think side bending, also known as lateral flexion), or back core (as in back bending, which is referred to as spinal extension). The term C curve refers to the rounded spine position where we use our front core to shorten the space from our pelvis to our shoulders. All three of these positions that require core strength are used in aerial and pole movements, however, students usually come across the C curve in spinal flexion first, and side and back bending on apparatus are usually introduced a bit later.
    p Core stability is important not only for aerial and pole, but also just for daily movements such as walking. Core stability refers to one’s ability to resist front, side, and back bending and rotation of the torso against external forces. For example, when static spinning on pole, one of the forces acting on the body is pushing the torso outwards from the pole, and core stability works to maintain the desired torso shape (which will depend on the type of spin and what shape you’re spinning into). When performing a standard straddle invert, we must use our front core to fight the force of gravity and prevent our spine from going into a back bend shape. Core stability is essential for injury prevention. If a student is struggling to achieve a certain movement, one of the most common issues is a lack of core stability. If the core is not stable, the body will feel heavy and will be difficult to control.
  section.p-1
    h2 Muscles in the core
    p Muscles are often classified as stabilizers or movers. A stabilizer muscle works to maintain a joint, limb, or body position and resists external forces.  A mover muscle is used to move the body into a particular position. The stabilizer muscles assist the primary movers by helping to prevent overuse of the movers as well as maximizing efficiency of the movers.

      figcaption
        | Image from https://lakecountrytraining.com/2017/12/20/core-training/
    p The main stabilizer muscles in the core are the transverse abdominis (located in the front core), the internal obliques (located in the sides), the multifidus (along the lumbar spine), the diaphragm (a corset-like muscle around the abdomen) and the pelvic floor muscles. The iliopsoas are also considered core stabilizers, as they attach the lumbar region of the spine (in the low back) to the pelvis. There are other muscles that are also used in core stability, but these are the main ones that we’ll be discussing here.
    p The primary movers of the core depend on the direction of the torso curl. To bring the body into a front C curve, the main mover muscle is the rectus abdominis (commonly referred to as the six-pack muscle). For side bending, the external obliques and quadratus lumborum must be used. The obliques are also used to rotate the torso. Back bending requires the erector spinae (sometimes referred to as paraspinals) and the latissimus dorsi to engage. Again, other muscles are involved but we will focus on these muscles here.
  section.p-1
    h2 Types of muscle engagement
    p There are three categories of muscle engagement, concentric, eccentric, and isometric. The type of muscle engagement depends on the length of the muscle that is being engaged relative to its length at rest. Most people are familiar with concentric engagement. A muscle is concentrically engaged if it is shortening under tension. For example, the rectus abdominis engages concentrically during a sit-up. A muscle is eccentrically engaged if it is lengthening under tension. During backbending, the abdominal muscles are being stretched, but they must also be eccentrically engaged. A muscle is isometrically contracted if it is maintaining its length while being engaged. This type of engagement is used to resist movement, and if a muscle is being contracted isometrically, then it is in a stabilizer role. Many exercises require the main mover muscles used to contract in all three of these ways, each at a different phase of the exercise.
    p Muscular co-contraction refers to when muscles on opposite sides of a joint contract. If a muscle engages concentrically on one side, the opposing muscle will engage eccentrically at the same time. For example, in a bicep curl, the bicep engages concentrically but the tricep also engages eccentrically. Co-contraction is important for joint stability.
  section.p-1
    h2 My Experience as an Autistic Movement Artist
    p There are many reasons why the core might not engage the way that it should in a particular movement. Sometimes there is a muscular weakness, but often other issues are involved. If you spend most of your day sitting, your core may be weak since it does not need to engage to stabilize the torso as much as when you are standing or performing an exercise.
    p Overactive hip flexors can also be a sign of core weakness or dysfunction. If the transverse abdominis, pelvic floor, and diaphragm are not engaging properly or are weak, the hip flexors may take over and act as core stabilizers. This can cause issues such as tight hip flexors and low back pain.
    p Another common issue I’ve seen in my students is diastasis recti. This is a condition where the rectus abdominis has been separated (into left and right parts) and is common after pregnancy. Note that if you have diastasis recti, you should consult your physician before trying out any of the exercises in this blog. Many of the standard exercises used to strengthen the core can make diastasis recti worse (including planks, sit-ups, and even the yoga pose downward dog), so it is important to check in with your doctor.

      figcaption
        | Standing posture. Note that my chest is slightly open.
    p Poor posture can contribute to core dysfunction. Every body is different, so there’s not just one posture that is perfect for everyone. In general, the ideal posture aligns joints vertically. In terms of standing, this means that there is a straight line from the ears, to the shoulders, to the hips, and finally the ankles. This same principle of stacking joints is used in acrobatics and aerial arts to position the body in the most efficient position for muscular endurance and stability. However, the most important thing is that the body is not always in the same position. Your body must be in different positions throughout the day to avoid over-using some muscles and over-stretching others. For example, somebody who is always in a slouched position will have over-stretched lats (latissimus dorsi).
    p Breathing issues can always cause core problems. Ideally, diaphragmatic breathing should be used. The diaphragm and pelvic floor are some of the main muscles required for breathing. The diaphragm allows for inhalation as it opens the ribs so that the lungs can expand. When breathing is functioning well, the diaphragm and pelvic floor move together in an up and down motion. Note that the rectus abdominis, obliques, and transverse abdominis are all used during the expiration phase of breathing. If someone is having core stability issues, it’s important to also check in with their breathing. In general, breath should not be held, as this can cause an internal pressure issue which can affect the core. Rib compression can negatively impact the pelvic floor-diaphragm movement. For example, over-training the expiration muscles can impede the diaphragm's ability to open the ribs, which is essential for the inspiration phase of breathing. If the ribs can't open enough, then the diaphgram and pelvic floor action can get thrown off. We will discuss proper breathing as it relates to the exercises that will be presented in a later section. In general, for exercises that bring the spine into flexion (like a sit-up), the breath should be exhaled during the sitting up phase of the exercise and inhalation should occur during the lowering down phase (when the rectus abdominis is contracted eccentrically).
  section.p-1
    h2 Exercise intention & goals
    p Have you ever felt confused about an exercise when two instructors taught it to you differently? I have! Instructors may teach exercises differently depending on their intention for the exercise. Most of the exercises that I will present here can be safely and productively performed in different positions and with a focus on various muscles. The way we position our bodies and the muscles that we choose to pay the most attention to will depend on what we hope to achieve with the exercise. I will try to clearly state my goals and intentions for each exercise, and I encourage you to always think about this when you work out as well. For example, if I’m warming up my front core for backbending, I may choose to have my spine in its natural position with a slight curve in the lumbar region of my spine. However, if I’m doing front core exercises to strengthen my spinal flexion, then I will generally keep my pelvis posteriorly tilted, eliminating the natural, slight, low back curve.
  section.p-1
    h2 What does deep core activation feel like?
    p Many of us struggle to know when our core is engaged and which muscles are being used. It is important to develop an awareness of the core in order to do exercises correctly. Here is a list of common cues used to activate the deep core (core stabilizer) muscles, such as the transverse abdominis and the pelvic floor:
    ul
      li Pretend you’re trying to stop the flow of urine (pelvic floor)
      li Suck your pelvic floor upwards (pelvic floor and diaphragm)
      li Suck your belly in towards your spine (transverse abdominis)
      li Bring your sit bones towards each other (pelvic floor)
      li Cough (transverse abdominis, pelvic floor, diaphragm)
    p Not all of these cues may work for you. Make sure that you don’t end up holding your breath to try to satisfy these directions - your pelvic floor and diaphragm should be able to continue moving up and down throughout most exercises. If your belly pooches out while doing a spinal flexion exercise, you may be under-utilizing your transverse abdominis or over-using your rectus abdominis. In general, if someone is engaging their abs but their belly is sticking out a bit, then the exercise is likely mainly working the rectus abdominis. Another thing to keep an eye on is leg and foot position - make sure both feet and knees are facing forward, and not turning outwards. For the exercises presented in this blog, we will try to shift our focus to the deeper core muscles. The transverse abdominis will have more of a flattening or corset-like effect on the belly when it is engaged.
    p If you’re struggling to feel and activate your deep core, you can try to squeeze something such as a yoga block between your thighs while you perform most core exercises. This squeezing action will bring your sit bones together and help you to engage your pelvic floor. If you still can’t feel your pelvic floor, you might benefit from consulting a specialist in case your pelvic floor is not functioning properly.
  section.p-1
    h2 Core stability in pole and aerial
    p When performing pole or aerial tricks, many forces are working to bend or rotate the torso in different directions. For this reason, the core stabilizers must be working the entire time. Now, this does not mean you should hold your breath and contract everything as hard as possible for an entire sequence of moves. Don’t forget that you still need to breathe normally, and your pelvic floor and diaphragm must work together while engaging and relaxing to allow this to happen.
    p During the lifting phase of any trick, exhaling will help your front core engage. For straddle inverts, ayesha deadlifts, and shoulder mounts, for example, the spine should be flexed in a C-curve shape. To safely maintain this position, the deep core muscles must be engaged and the pelvis should be tucked (posteriorly tilted). To maintain the posterior tilt of the pelvis, the rectus abdominis and obliques must engage concentrically.
    p If you’re struggling with any pole or aerial move, think about which direction the forces are pushing you. For example, in a straddle invert, gravity is working to push the hips and legs back down. To prevent gravity from winning, our core must stabilize to prevent spinal extension. To give another example, in order to hold an iron-x or flag shape, we must prevent our torso from going into lateral flexion. Once you determine the main core stabilizers and movers for the trick that you are working on, you can choose appropriate off-pole core exercises to strengthen those muscles and help you achieve your goal.
  section.p-1
    h2 Core stability in backbending
    p The core is also essential for a strong backbend. The deep core muscles should be engaged in a backbend to support the spine. The front core muscles will be eccentrically contracted, while the back core muscles must engage concentrically. Because the core muscles must be strong in their lengthened position, it is important to incorporate some core exercises that strengthen the ab muscles in this lengthened position as part of a backbending warm-up routine. The pelvis will be tilted anteriorly, however, the rectus abdominis should engage as if trying to pull the pelvis into posterior tilt. The glute muscles can also act as core stabilizers, and they must engage to prevent pinching in the low back. The glute max is particularly important in backbending, and it works to keep the hips in extension and the legs in slight internal rotation which helps maintain the pelvic tilt. Any low back discomfort during or after backbending is possibly due to a core issue or insufficient glute engagement.
  section.p-1
    h2 Exercises
    p Here are some of my favorite core exercises. In general, the slower you can go, the better. If you have any injuries, make sure to consult your physician before trying these.
    h3 Plank
    .p-1.text-center
      iframe(src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/aDSWHpcah88', title='YouTube video player', allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture', allowfullscreen='', width='740', height='416', frameborder='0')
    h4 My Intention
    p In terms of core, I use the plank exercise to strengthen my core stability. In particular, when done correctly, it builds core strength to prevent spinal extension. It’s also a great way to build shoulder strength.
    h4 What to look for
    ul
      li The shoulder blades should be protracted (spread wide across the back)
      li The torso should be sucking in, as if wearing an invisible corset, which indicates that the deep core is properly engaged
      li The spine should be in a neutral position. Watch out for low back arch (anterior tilt of the pelvis) and for an overly tucked pelvis (posterior tilt). A slight posterior tuck is ok, but not a full tuck.
      li Squeeze your glutes to maintain hip extension.
      li Keep ribs in.
    h4 Core Muscles
    p The core muscles should all be engaged isometrically.
    h4 Variations
    ul
      li Planks can be done on forearms or hands. If someone has a wrist injury, they should use the forearm variation. I also like to use my forearms to build my elbow pushing strength, which is used in forearm bracket grip on pole.
      li Planks can be done on knees. If someone cannot maintain proper spinal position and core engagement, then they should start on their knees.
      li Lifting one limb off the ground. This is a great way to increase anti-rotational stability of the core.
    h3 Side Plank
    .p-1.text-center
      iframe(src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/A-bAMVXZpM4', title='YouTube video player', allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture', allowfullscreen='', width='740', height='416', frameborder='0')
    h4 My Intention
    p Side plank is great for increasing core stability against lateral flexion. It’s also great for shoulder strength.
    h4 What to look for
    ul
      li The shoulder blades should be protracted (spread wide across the back)
      li The torso should be sucking in, as if wearing an invisible corset, which indicates that the deep core is properly engaged
      li The spine should be in a neutral position. Watch out for low back arch (anterior tilt of the pelvis) and for an overly tucked pelvis (posterior tilt). A slight posterior tuck is ok, but not a full tuck.
      li Make sure there is a straight line from your hand or elbow on the ground (depending on the variation you’re doing), to your hips, and to your feet.
      li Keep ribs in.
      li Squeeze your glutes to maintain hip extension.
    h4 Core Muscles
    p The core muscles should all be engaged isometrically. The internal obliques will be working especially hard.
    h4 Variations
    ul
      li Planks can be done on forearms or hands. If someone has a wrist injury, they should use the forearm variation. I also like to use my forearms to build my elbow pushing strength, which is used in forearm bracket grip on pole.
      li Planks can be done on knees. If someone cannot maintain proper spinal position and core engagement, then they should start on their knees.
      li Lift your top leg up using your adductors to increase the difficulty for the core stabilizers.
      li Add a torso rotation to incorporate oblique strengthening.
    h3 Dead Bugs
    .p-1.text-center
      iframe(src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/CGHs_W-p9KI', title='YouTube video player', allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture', allowfullscreen='', width='740', height='416', frameborder='0')
    h4 My Intention
    p Dead bugs build core stability. If I’m having a student do dead bugs to strengthen their core for pole or aerial, I will have them keep their pelvis posteriorly tilted. If a student is warming up for backbending, the spine should be in a neutral position, with a small space between their low back and the floor.
    h4 What to look for
    ul
      li Note whether there is a space under the low back or not. Make sure this is consistent with the pelvic position that aligns with your intention for this exercise.
      li The space between the low back and the floor should not change at any point during this exercise, especially if the legs are moved as in some of the optional variations.
      li Tension in the upper back or neck. Keep your head resting on the ground and try not to use the upper back or neck muscles in place of the deep core muscles.
      li Keep legs hip width apart.
      li Keep shins parallel to the floor.
      li Keep knees over hips. Make sure knees don’t drift closer to your head, this makes the exercise much easier.
      li Keep ribs in.
      li If performing a variation where legs are lowered, exhale each time you lower a leg.
    h4 Core Muscles
    p The core muscles should all be engaged isometrically.
    h4 Variations
    ul
      li The dead bug can be progressed to hollow body holds. Use the following progressions:
      ul
        li Keeping knees bent at 90 degrees, tap one foot at a time on the ground
        li Straighten one leg at a time
        li Straighten both legs
        li Bring shoulders into full flexion (the angle at the armpit is 180 degrees and arms are reaching overhead)
      li Push hands on knees to start. This will force your hip flexors to activate. Extend one arm and one leg at a time, then bring them back together and repeat on the other side. Continue for as long as you can maintain the proper position, up to a couple minutes.
      li Put a miniband around both feet making sure to keep feet flexed. Extend one leg at a time, activating your hip flexors. Another option is to also curl the head and chest up to add rectus abdominis concentric engagement.
    h3 Hip Bridge
    .p-1.text-center
      iframe(src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/tofg4q7czNc', title='YouTube video player', allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture', allowfullscreen='', width='740', height='416', frameborder='0')
    h4 My Intention
    p Hip bridges can be used to address a variety of issues, such as glute weakness, tight hip flexors, and core stability.
    h4 What to look for
    ul
      li The pelvis should be tucked and glutes squeezed.
      li Feet and knees should be hip width apart. Make sure your knees don't go outwards as you lift your hips.
      li Spine should be rounded and in flexion.
      li Keep your neck and upper back relaxed to avoid neck tension.
      li If lifting a leg to perform a variation, exhale while lifting.
    h4 Core Muscles
    p The front core muscles should all be engaged concentrically. Back core stabilizers will engage eccentrically.
    h4 Variations
    ul
      li Squeeze a yoga block between thighs to assist pelvic floor engagement
      li Lift one leg at a time to work rotational stability.
    h3 Roll Up
    .p-1.text-center
      iframe(src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/vaMMSGgyblQ', title='YouTube video player', allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture', allowfullscreen='', width='740', height='416', frameborder='0')
    h4 My Intention
    p I use roll ups to strengthen the core stabilizers and increase spinal flexion strength. I slightly tuck my pelvis to train for pole and aerial inversions.
    h4 What to look for
    ul
      li The spine will be slightly rounded, but do not over-tuck the pelvis. If you struggle to finish the lift up or if your feet come off the ground, your pelvis may be over-tucked.
      li If your neck or upper back feels discomfort or tires, you may be over-rounding your upper spine.
      li Exhale during the lifting phase.
    h4 Core Muscles
    p The front core muscles should all be engaged concentrically.
    h4 Variations
    ul
      li To build up to this movement, try holding onto your thighs as you lower down.
      li Another modification is to hold on to a stretchy band placed around feet.
    h3 Hollow Body Roll
    .p-1.text-center
      iframe(src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/c9jw7cEiQ70', title='YouTube video player', allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture', allowfullscreen='', width='740', height='416', frameborder='0')
    h4 My Intention
    p Hollow body rolls increase core stability and strengthen the C-curve in spinal flexion, extension, and lateral flexion.
    h4 What to look for
    ul
      li The hips should be in extension the entire time. This is achieved by engaging the glutes. Make sure the angle at the hip joint is never less than 180 degrees (if hip flexors are tight, then maintain the largest angle you can)
      li Arms and legs should be straight
      li Legs should squeeze together
      li When in the hollowbody phase, shoulder blades should be protracted
      li When in the arched phased, shoulder blades should be retracted
      li Shoulders should be externally rotated. Look for wrapping of the armpits.
    h4 Core Muscles
    p The core stabilizers and glutes should be engaged the entire time. During the hollow body phase, the rectus abdominis is working concentrically to maintain the posterior tilt of the pelvis, and the back muscles engage eccentrically. During the arched phase, the back muscles engage concentrically while the front core contracts eccentrically. During the lateral flexion phase, the obliques engage concentrically and eccentrically (depending on which side is in lateral flexion).
    h4 Variations
    ul
      li If you’re building up to this movement, work all four C-curves on their on first - hollowbody, arched body, left C-curve, and right C-curve
      li Squeeze a yoga block between your legs to increase pelvic floor engagement and squeeze a block between your hands if you’re struggling to maintain external rotation in your shoulders
    h3 V-Sits
    .p-1.text-center
      iframe(src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/bpKZla8Miv8', title='YouTube video player', allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture', allowfullscreen='', width='740', height='416', frameborder='0')
    h4 My Intention
    p V-sits are one of my favorite exercises to strengthen the core for straddle inversions and for handstand press. They improve core strength in an open chain position (feet not on the ground), which is essential for pole and aerial. I usually perform these in a slight tuck to train for inversions.
    h4 What to look for
    ul
      li Begin in a hollow body position except with hands reaching forward instead of overhead.
      li The spine will be in a neutral position. Do not over-tuck your pelvis. If you find yourself rolling back, you likely have tucked your pelvis.
      li If your neck or upper back feels discomfort or tires, you may be over-rounding your upper spine.
      li Keep legs squeezed together.
      li Exhale during the lifting phase.
    h4 Core Muscles
    p The front core muscles should all be engaged isometrically.
    h4 Variations
    ul
      li Bend legs
      li Keep legs together during the lifting phase, and then straddle legs apart and brings arms between legs
      li Put a miniband around thighs and separate legs, pushing into the band, if you struggle with hip impingement.
      li (Advanced) After lifting up into the V-shape, place hands flat on the floor next to hips, and push into the ground to lift hips up. The goal is to maintain the V-shape while lifting - I still struggle with this part!
    h3 Back Extension
    .p-1.text-center
      iframe(src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZOzJXHHDkE4', title='YouTube video player', allow='accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture', allowfullscreen='', width='740', height='416', frameborder='0')
    h4 My Intention
    p This exercise is a great way to warm up for backbending as well as just increasing back body C-curve strength. Sometimes I use this exclusively for my mid and upper back, in which case I keep my legs heavy and on the ground. If I also want to strengthen my lower back, then I lift my legs. I keep my shoulder blades protracted when I'm training for pole or aerial, and I sometimes retract my shoulder blades when warming up for backbending.
    h4 What to look for
    ul
      li If warming up for backbending, keep the neck in a neutral position, and look at the floor. Lift legs only an inch or two off the ground to engage the low back instead of letting the glutes and hamstrings take over. Keep glutes and hamstrings relaxed.
      li If strengthening the entire back body, lift legs, arms, and head high, but keep your gaze down or slightly forward to avoid neck tension.
      li I exhale during the lifting phase because this helps me engage my back core concentrically. Some instructors teach students to exhale during the lowering phase to increase the backbend, but I find that this makes it more likely for my ribs to flare, and ribs should be pulled in.
      li If strengthening for backbending, keep arms in external rotation. Squeeze a block between hands if you struggle with this.
      li Arms and legs can be slightly wider than hip width, however, determine the appropriate spacing depending on your goals (generally arms should be shoulder width apart or slightly wider, legs can be together or slightly wider than hip width apart).
    h4 Core Muscles
    p The back core is engaged concentrically, and the front core muscles are engaged eccentrically.
    h4 Variations
    ul
      li Have someone hold feet in place, or hook feet under something. This will increase the range of the movement.
      li Push feet into a wall. This will also allow for more spinal extension.
    h3 Side Crunches

    h4 My Intention
    p I use side crunches to strengthen the obliques as movers.
    h4 What to look for
    ul
      li Try to keep the hip flexors in extension and squeeze your glutes.
      li Keep your spine neutral and do not let your low back arch.
      li Exhale during the lifting phase.
    h4 Core Muscles
    p The obliques on one side engage concentrically, while the obliques on the other side engage concentrically. The transverse abdominis, pelvic floor, diaphragm, and other stabilizers engage isometrically.
    h4 Variations
    ul
      li Bend knees and keeps legs on the ground
      li Use a stability ball under hips so lateral flexion can be trained on both sides in each rep

    h2 Measuring Progress
    p Whenever I create a new workout, I make sure to include my goals for the workout and when and how to measure my progress towards these goals. For example, if you’re working on core stability to improve your invert, you should check in with your invert regularly. You can also measure your progress by recording how many reps you can do or the length of time that you can hold a particular pose for. If you don’t see any progress after a few months, it’s a good idea to re-evaluate your workout and check in with a coach.
    p There are dozens of other amazing core exercises. This blog focused more on core stabilization. I will eventually share a follow-up blog with my favorite core strengthening exercises. Let me know if you try these exercises or if you have any questions!
    p Special thanks to PT Ruby for reviewing this blog!
