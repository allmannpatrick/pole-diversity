This is a simple website for a circus troupe. It hosts some embedded istagram posts, a blog, and a contact form using nodemailer. Node with express and pug. No real front end except bootstrap 4 which relies on jQuery. Plans to add a comment capability for each blog post are upcoming.

Thanks to this [stack exhange post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23699773/bootstrap-change-background-color-dropdown-menu) and the navbar template from [bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com/simplex/).
